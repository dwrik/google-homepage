# The google homepage?

This is a basic project built as an exercise to practice my skills in ``` html```, ```css```, ```css-grid``` and ```css-flexbox```. The project has been built as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/home) full stack curriculum that am currently undertaking.

As for the project, I tried to make the frontend of the page resemble the real website  as closely as possible with my limited knowledge. The links are all dead except for the user icon which links back to my github page.
